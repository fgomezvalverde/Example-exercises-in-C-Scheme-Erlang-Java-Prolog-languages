# Example exercises in (C,Scheme,Erlang,Java,Prolog) languages

Prolog module: very easy exercises to get started in Prolog, like; fibonacci, factorial and some for lists.
C module: is a genetic algorithm with his normals parts; create a random start poblation, define generations, selection, crossovers and mutation porcentage.
Erlang module: is the implementation of Huffman algorithm to compress files, using threads for make it faster.
Java module: using xmls to define if the automaton is an NFA or DFA, based on this states and transitions.
Scheme module: with a initial poblations of 2 number each pair and a fuction, used a genetic algorithm to define with poblation fit better to the function and them to graph those poblation with the funtion in a 
Cartesian plane.
